TODO :
- Create style specific backgrounds and colors in the styles-highlighter.css
- make color highlighting mechanism style-aware (e.g by passing the class to use into markSelection).
- Our commands only get registered once we have executed the default toggle command once (at least at Julian's slightly buggy dev Workspace).
- Markers can't be removed yet (implementation of the clear methods still missing)
- When these are ready, we should observe what we should do next.
